        Hi there! I&apos;m a Full Stack Developer with 5 years of experience,
        comfortable on both front and back end. Coding isn&apos;t just my job;
        it&apos;s my favorite hobby, too. I&apos;ve spent a lot of time in the
        MERN stack (my personal favorite) but am currently working with Angular
        and PostgreSQL. <br />
        <br />A little about my past—back in the day, I almost went pro in
        soccer (we call it football back in Europe but let&apos;s not get into
        it this time). Let&apos;s just say “that bad injury” (okay, life
        choices) took me down a different path.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, I&apos;m as serious about my career in tech as I once was about the
        field. Outside of work, I&apos;m all about self-development and a
        well-organized schedule, though I can be resilient when things
        don&apos;t go as planned. I&apos;m also working on my own project, an
        app called Eden, built with React Native, which I&apos;m excited to
        release in 2025. (More on that when the time is right!)
